# engineSync

Application to sync EngineDJ (Desktop) Library Backups to drives.

Works (developed and tested) on macOS Ventura ðŸŽ‰

This tool was created because macOS Ventura changed something with EXFAT/FAT handling which in turn broke EngineDJ. 
This tool simply copies the necessary files and makes adjustments to the file paths in the engine database file, it doesn't check for a specific partition format and so is not affected by that bug.

This tool is not supported by Denon/InMusic; Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of the page.

## Features

- Syncs entire library to a given drive/directory
- Syncs a SoundSwitch project to the target drive
- Fixes DB entries for track paths according to what's been synced
- Works on macOS Ventura (and probably every OS golang runs on)

### What it can't do

- Sync stuff back into your Engine DJ Library
- Recognize existing libraries 
  - it overwrites everything without checking
- Work with non-Backup folders (ie. a regular library)
  - they contain "invalid" paths to the tracks, the backup contains the proper working paths

## Usage

1. Download the tool ([Latest Release](https://github.com/lfuelling/engineSync/releases/latest))
2. Organize your Music using engineDJ (which runs good enough for that purpose on macOS Ventura)
3. (OPTIONAL) Organize your light show using SoundSwitch (also still running on Ventura)
4. Close engineDJ, let it create a **Library Backup** (this is important)
   1. From the EnginDJ menu, select 'Preferences'

   2. From the 'Library' Tab, scroll down and select 'Backup'

5. Attach your drive, make sure it's formatted to EXFAT or FAT!
   - **I have bricked my drive previously with the bugged engineDJ, so my drive was freshly formatted**
   - **I have not tested this tool with an existing library on the drive**
   - **it might not work and will definitely leave duplicate files on the drive if it already contains a library**
6. Open the tool using alt+open (otherwise the "Open" button will be missing in the warning by macOS)
7. Follow the instructions in the tool window and wait for the sync to finish
   1. Select the "Engine Library Backup" folder
   2. (Optional) select the SoundSwitch project
   3. Select the target drive
   4. Click "Start Sync" and wait
8. **Properly Eject your drive!**
9. Insert your drive into any engineDJ player and enjoy.

## Development

2. Install dependencies:
   - Download or install golang
3. Build:
